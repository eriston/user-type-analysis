# user-type-analysis
r script to analyze users based on aggregate information about event attendance

## Summary
Performs analysis on some preprocessed data and clusters the users into 4 groups, of which 2 represent over 90% of the users. The two large groups segment the customers into two primary types. Further elaboration temporarily embargoed.

The smaller of the two dominate groups represents customers who attend a large number of less expensive events and are wiling to travel significant distances to do so.

The larger group is comprised of customers who attend a few larger, more expensive, events primarily located in their home market.
